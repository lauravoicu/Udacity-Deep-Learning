Repository for projects developed in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree. 

## Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

**Short description:** Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bike-share users on a given day.

**Tools and technologies:** Neural networks, Deep Learning, PyTorch

## Project 2: Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media 

**Short description:** Machine learning design process end-to-end: performing data preprocessing and augmentation, designing the CNN from scratch, and training and saving tje best CNN model; use transfer learning and compare the transfer-learned model with the from-scratch CNN. 

**Tool and technologies:** CNN, Transfer learning, PyTorch.

## Project 3: Generate TV Scripts

**Short description:** Build Recurrent Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks with PyTorch; perform sentiment analysis and generate new text, and use recurrent networks to generate new text that resembles a training set of TV scripts. 

**Tools and technologies:** RNN, LSTM, Hyperparameter tuning.

## Project 4: Generate Faces

**Short description:** implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) made of a pair of multi-layer neural networks that compete against each other until one learns to generate realistic images of faces.

**Tools and technologies:** GAN, Deep Convolutional GAN.

## Project 5: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model 

**Short description:** train and deploy a PyTorch sentiment analysis model using Amazon SageMaker on AWS. This model will be trained to do sentiment analysis on movie reviews (positive or negative reviews). End to end project: build the model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing this model from a website.

**Tool and technologies:** Amazon SageMaker, AWS.

## Contributing

I use this for my own projects, I know this might not be the perfect approach for all the projects out there. If you have any ideas, just [open an issue][issues] and tell me what you think.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome.
